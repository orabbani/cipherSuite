# cipherSuite
A collection of basic tools for use in encryption/decryption of text files and strings.
This is my personal interpretation of the code I find as I read "Cracking Codes with Python" and learn about ciphers.
Much of it is pretty much the same as what you would find in the book, with variables named something I find a little more conducive to programming, personally.
Some of it has been altered to be interoperable with current and future features as I come up with ideas.
This whole thing is just a learning experience for me. I'm only using github as a backup.
